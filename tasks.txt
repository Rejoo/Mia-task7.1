Problem 1: Bat-Signal
About
The Bat-Signal is a crucial element in Gotham City's defense
strategy, used by Commissioner Gordon to alert Batman of
immediate threats and criminal activities. It projects a large, luminous
bat symbol into the night sky, signaling Batman to take action.
However, the current signal system is outdated and prone to failures.
Your mission is to upgrade the Bat-Signal to ensure it operates
efficiently and reliably, providing a bright and unmistakable call for
help whenever Gotham is in danger.
Description
1. Design a circuit that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V
DC and connects LED to the output and make a switching circuit to
control this led (Hint: firstly, you need to step down the AC, then you
need to convert AC to DC, and lastly connect the load).
2. If the input power budget of your power supply is 1440W, and you
use a current limiting resistor with each LED 330 ohm. Estimate
how many LEDs could be put in parallel that is suitable for this
power budget.(Npte: the LED will be burnt out after 100mA)
Problem 2: Building Pyramids in Atlantis
About
Atlantis, the legendary underwater kingdom ruled by Aquaman, has
numerous gates that control the flow of water and access to various
areas within the kingdom. These gates are crucial for maintaining the
security and stability of Atlantis. However, the current control systems
are outdated and need an upgrade to ensure they function reliably
under the harsh underwater conditions.
Description
Design a simple H-bridge driver to control the direction of the DC
motor which opens and closes the gate using transistors
(MOSFETs or BJTs).
Problem 3: Cyborg’s Battery Selection
About
Cyborg, a vital member of the Justice League, depends on advanced
cybernetic enhancements powered by a sophisticated energy core.
To enhance his performance and ensure sustained operation during
intense missions, you need to design an optimal battery configuration
that maximizes power output while minimizing weight and ensuring
reliability.
Description
One of Cyborg’s parts needs a power solution for four 12V motors,
each drawing 4A continuously, and a camera drawing 0.5A at 12V. The
system must operate for at least half an hour on a single charge. You
may use more than one battery to meet this requirement, but aim to
minimize weight, size, and cost.
Your task is to identify the most suitable battery by balancing cost,
performance, weight, and size. Search for suitable batteries in both
local (Egypt) and international online stores. Justify your choice and
include a factor of safety in your calculations to ensure the system's
reliability.
