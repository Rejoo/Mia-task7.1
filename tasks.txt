Task 6: Batmobile Motor Control
About
Gotham City is under threat, and the Justice League needs your
help! Batman's iconic Batmobile, a crucial asset in the fight
against crime, requires a new motor control system to enhance
its agility and speed. Your mission is to design an H-bridge circuit
that will enable the Batmobile to maneuver swiftly and safely
through the dark alleys and streets of Gotham.
Components
4 Data header to represent the microcontroller signals
2 rosetta (screw terminals block) one for the battery and one for
the motor
2 n-channels mosfets
2 p-channel mosfets
Resistors + Consider Safety considerations
Requirements
Design an H-bridge circuit in Altium to control the direction
and speed of a 12V, 3A DC motor. Consider including features
that can help protect the circuit and the motor from potential
issues.
● Do you need flyback diodes for the motors? (Like we used
with the transistor).
● If you do, how would you connect flyback diodes to a
bi-directional load like a motor?
Submission
● You will submit your schematic and board as a zip file using a drive
