Problem 2: Green Lantern's Array
About
Green Lantern, using his power ring's ability to construct various
structures, has created an array where each element represents
a unique energy signature. Your mission is to search through this
array and find the position of a specific energy signature,
demonstrating your prowess in searching algorithms.
Description
Write a program to search for a specific value in an array of
integers and return its index if found. If the value is not present,
the program should return -1.
Input
● The first line contains an integer n, where n is the number of
elements in the array.
● The second line contains n space-separated integers
representing the elements of the array.
● The third line contains the integer target, which is the value to
search for.
Output
● Output the index of the target in the array (0-based index).
● If the target is not found in the array, output -1.
Example
Input
5

data.
Description
Write a program that takes a list of integers representing heights
achieved during flight training and returns the maximum height
recorded.
Input
● The first line contains an integer n, the number of height
measurements.
● The second line contains n space-separated integers
representing the heights in meters.
Output

Problem 4: Battle Planning with Batman
About
Batman has summoned you to the Batcave for strategic planning
against powerful villains. Your objective is to analyze two grids: one
representing the power levels of the Justice League and the other
representing the power levels of the villains across different areas of
the battlefield.
Description
Write a program to determine which team, either the Justice League
or the villains, wins in the majority of corresponding cells based on
their power levels. The winner in each cell is determined as follows:
● If justice_league[i][j] > villains[i][j], the Justice
League wins in that area.
● If justice_league[i][j] < villains[i][j], the villains
win in that area.
● If justice_league[i][j] == villains[i][j], it results
in a tie for that area.
The overall winner is the team that wins in the majority of areas
compared to the other team.
Input
● The first line contains two integers r and c, where r is the
number of rows and c is the number of columns in the grids.
● The next r lines contain c space-separated integers representing
the power levels of the Justice League.
● The following r lines contain c space-separated integers
representing the power levels of the villains.
Output
● Output the name of the team that wins in the majority of
corresponding cells either “Justice League” or “Villains”. If both
teams win an equal number of cells, output "Tie".
