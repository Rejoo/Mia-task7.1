Task 5.1: Arkham Asylum Secure Communication
System
About
Arkham Asylum, the infamous prison for Gotham's most
dangerous criminals, is now utilizing advanced technology to
ensure the containment of its inmates. Batman has tasked you
with setting up a secure communication network within the
asylum. The system must allow different parts of the facility to
communicate through a central control unit, ensuring that
messages are relayed without any direct connections, which
could be compromised.
Requirements
Implement a communication system where:
● The master Arduino acts as the central control unit.
● The first slave Arduino is connected to the master using I2C.
● The second slave Arduino is connected to the master using
serial communication.
● Send a message from one slave to the other relaying
through the master without any direct connection between
the two slaves.
Task 5.2: Digital world
About
Central City is under constant threat from rogue speedsters and
villains. With meta-human criminals wreaking havoc, The Flash
needs a robust surveillance system to monitor the city. STAR
Labs has developed an advanced network of sensors that
capture various signals indicating disturbances, unusual activity,
and potential threats. However, to process and analyze these
signals effectively, they must be converted from analog to digital
form. You have been tasked with designing and implementing this
conversion system.
Requirements
if we need to convert this analog to digital signal what is the
digital sequence if we use ADC with :
● 3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.25sec,
● 3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.5sec,
● 3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 1sec,
● 2-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.25sec,
at each point draw the discrete signal also (the step after time
sampling and quantization)
what is your conclusion from this problem
