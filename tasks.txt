Task 4.1: Understanding The Weather
About
Red Tornado is on a mission to understand weather patterns
better to aid in disaster prevention and management. Using his
computational abilities, he needs to analyze a dataset containing
historical weather data. Your mission is to help Red Tornado load,
clean, and preprocess the dataset, then visualize key aspects of
the data to extract meaningful insights.
Requirements
● Load the dataset as a dataframe.
● Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values,
remove duplicates and handle incorrect data).
● Plot temperature over time.
● Create a histogram of temperature distribution.
● Plot a scatter plot of temperature vs. humidity.
● Generate a correlation heatmap of the dataset and explain the
output in a markdown cell.

Task 4.2: Battle Planning with Batman 2
About
Batman has gathered his allies to plan a strategic battle against
the villains, including Joker, Harley Quinn, and others. Using a
chessboard as the battlefield, Batman must maneuver his pieces
to outwit and defeat the villains. Each chess piece represents a
member of the Justice League or an ally of Batman, while the
opposing pieces represent various villains. Your mission is to
implement a chess game to help the justice league simulate their
strategies.
Requirements
● Implement the Chess Logic (Basic Moves Only): Use
python to create the core of the chess game.
1. Handle piece movements (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop,
Queen and King movements).
2. Switch between the two players.
3. Implement game rules like checkmate.
● Create a GUI
● Document Every Step: Detailed documentation for your code,
making it easy to understand and highlight any additional
features implemented such as special moves (castling,en
passant or pawn promotion) where using special moves is
totally optional.
Hint: Use Pygame library for the GUI.
Bonus
● Document your code using readme file (.md).
● Flip the board for each player’s turn.
● Convert the game to a single-player mode.
Task 4.3: Predicting The Weather
About
Red Storm, a superhero with the power to control weather
patterns, needs to predict future weather conditions to prevent
natural disasters and assist in planning rescue missions. By
leveraging historical weather data, Red Storm aims to develop a
machine learning model that can accurately forecast upcoming
weather conditions. Let's help Red Storm achieve this goal by
creating the model.
Objectives
To predict the weather conditions based on historical weather
data using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes
features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
The goal is to train a model that can accurately forecast future
weather conditions.
Use google colab or jupyter notebook in vs
Requirements
● Create a Machine Learning Model to predict the weather
conditions.
● Use the given dataset , hint ( use the numerical features only )
and answer the following questions according to the model
you created .
● Copy each question in a markdown cell and answer it below
the code.
1. What type of machine learning problem is this?
2. How do the features relate to each other and to the
weather conditions?
3. What are the steps involved in preprocessing the
dataset for machine learning?
4. How do we select the best model for our dataset? Hint :
use different regression models and compare their
metrics
5. What metrics should we use to evaluate the
performance of our weather prediction model?
6. Plot the predicted vs true values
Dataset:WeatherHistory Dataset

Objectives
Segmentation of the mall customers from the attached Mall
Customers Dataset.
Use google colab or jupyter notebook in vs.
Requirements
● Create a Segmentation algorithm to segment the mall
customers.
● Copy each question in a markdown cell and answer it below
the code.
1. What type of machine learning problem is this?
2. What machine learning algorithms are suitable for customer
segmentation tasks?
3. Plot the Answer (hint : use scatter plot)
Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset
