Preface
Batman has discovered that the Joker has planted mines across Gotham
City. These mines emit light, and Batman has designed a minesweeper bot
mini-tank to detect and neutralize these bombs. Your mission is to build and
program this bot to help Batman save the city. Follow these steps to ensure
the safety of Gotham:
1. Detecting Mines: Equip the mini-tank with a photoresistor to detect
the light emitted by the mines. When light is detected, the bot will
activate a buzzer to signal the presence of a mine.
2. Defusing Mines: Implement a mechanism to defuse the bomb using a
servo motor.
3. Navigating the City: Program the tank to yaw right, yaw left, move
forward, and move backward.
4. Avoiding Obstacles: Equip the mini-tank with ultrasonic sensors to
detect and avoid obstacles such as walls and debris.
5. Localization: After each movement, the tank should track its location
within the city.
Problem 1: Detecting Mines
Description
The streets of Gotham are dark, and the Joker's mines emit just
enough light to be detectable but not immediately noticeable to the
naked eye. Your bot will serve as Batman's eyes, patrolling the city to
find these hidden dangers.
Connect a Photoresistor: The photoresistor will be the bot's primary
sensor, detecting light from the mines. It must be connected to the
Arduino Uno via a breadboard and resistors to accurately read light
levels.
Activate the Buzzer: Once a mine is detected, the bot needs to
signal using a buzzer. When the photoresistor detects light above a
certain threshold (assume 500), the buzzer will sound, alerting the
presence of a mine.

Problem 2: Defusing Mines
Description
To neutralize the mines, your bot needs to perform a specific action.
The bot will use a servo motor to create this mechanism, moving in a
precise pattern to defuse the mine.
Using a servo motor, you will move the mechanism from 0 to 60
degrees, defuse the bomb in 2 seconds and then will rotate back to 0
degrees.
Components
● Servo motor(micro servo in Tinkercad)
● Arduino Uno
● Breadboard
Problem 3: Movement
Description
To effectively patrol the perilous streets of Gotham and locate the
Joker's hidden mines, Batman's mini-tank must navigate in specific
patterns using 2 wheels. This involves precise movements in yaw
directions, forward, and backward. Your task is to program the tank to
execute these movements using an L298N motor driver and two DC
motors. The ability to yaw right and left allows the tank to scan its
surroundings comprehensively, while forward and backward
movements ensure it can systematically cover the ground.
The mini-tank should perform the following sequence:
1. Yaw Right: Rotate 90 degrees to the right by activating the left
motor forward and the right motor backward for 1 second.
2. Yaw Left: Rotate 90 degrees to the left by activating the right
motor forward and the left motor backward for 1 second.
3. Move Forward: Advance 1 meter by activating both motors
forward for 1 second.
4. Move Backward: Reverse 1 meter by activating both motors
backward for 1 second.
Your task is to move the robot in every direction of the above and
print in the serial monitor where the robot is moving.

Problem 4: Obstacle Detection
Description
Gotham's streets are fraught with obstacles like walls, debris, and
other hazards that could hinder Batman's mini-tank. To ensure safe
and efficient navigation while searching for mines, the mini-tank
needs the capability to detect obstacles in its path. Your task is to
equip the tank with ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles by
measuring the distance to them and print a message to the serial
monitor when an object is detected within a specific range.
Your task is to print that an object detected whenever the ultrasonic
detects anything in its range.

● Ultrasonic Sensor

Bonus Problem: Integrate and Localise
Description
In this final challenge, you will integrate all the components into a fully
operational minesweeper tank designed to navigate Gotham's streets,
detect obstacles, locate mines, and defuse them. The tank must also be
capable of localizing its position within the city's grid to ensure
thorough coverage.
Your tasks include:
1. Integration of Components: Combine the ultrasonic sensors,
photoresistor, buzzer, servo motor, and motor driver into a
cohesive system.
2. Movement and Navigation: Program the tank to move in various
directions, including yawing, moving forward, and backward as
mentioned in problem 3.
3. Obstacle Detection: Utilize four or less ultrasonic sensors
positioned at specific angles to detect obstacles and adjust the
tank’s path accordingly as in problem 4.
4. Mine Detection and Defusing: Implement systems to detect mines
using the photoresistor and defuse them using the mechanism
controlled by the servo motor as in problems 1 and 2.
5. Localization: Incorporate a system to localize the tank’s position
within the 50m x 60m city grid. After each movement, the tank
should print its current position to provide real-time localization
data.
● You will move through the city printing you current location,
defuse bombs if detected, print when the bomb is detected and
when defused and avoid moving through the obstacles.
● Assume that the obstacles will never make you move backward (all
your movements will be rotation and forward)
● Assume the origin of the city on the left-down corner
● Take into the consideration the new axis of the bot and the
arrangement of the ultrasonic sensors after each rotation.
● Remember you can move in these ways:
○ Yaw Right: Rotate 90 degrees to the right by activating the left
motor forward and the right motor backward for 1 second.
○ Yaw Left: Rotate 90 degrees to the left by activating the right
motor forward and the left motor backward for 1 second.
○ Move Forward: Advance 1 meter by activating both motors
forward for 1 second.
Note: You can do as much as you can in this problem, even if you didn’t
do all the requirements.
